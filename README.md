# Soft Experience Cap

[Battletech Mod][ModTek] Mission experience only gets rewarded up to a certain limit which is expandable with the right Argo upgrades.  An optional pilot respec with the chosen XP Cap is included. Some possibilities to gain additional XP exist.

## Gameplay changes
* Pilots gain experience normally until they hit the current limit
  * Argo training modules raise this limit
  * Argo descriptions for training modules show the related limits
* An (optional) ability reset is included and can be enabled in mod.json settings
  * It's only usable ONCE per default...
  * But a setting to force it again is included too
  * The reset makes use of current xp cap of course
* Additional XP can be gained through:
  * Killing enemy units
  * Doing missions with less than a full lance
  * Keep piloted 'Mechs undamaged
  * Doing missions with less tonnage than advised (Going Steiner Scout will hurt XP though...)

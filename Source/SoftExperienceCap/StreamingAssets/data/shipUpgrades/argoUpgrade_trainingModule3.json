        "Details" : "With a training space completely packed with Battle Pods, MechWarriors can engage in lance-versus-lance competition, and that inevitably means teams, logos, and pennants. Large-scale competition means even more experience for participating MechWarriors. Each MechWarrior with less than 30.000 total experience will gain 50 experience points per day. Mission experience can be fully utilized up to a total of 65.000 points."

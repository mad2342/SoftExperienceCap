# Soft Experience Cap

[Battletech Mod][ModTek] Mission experience only gets rewarded up to a certain limit which is expandable with the right Argo Upgrades. If mechwarriors reach this experience cap they'll only get additional XP for each killed opponent on the field.

## Gameplay changes
* Pilots gain experience normally until they hit the current limit
  * Argo training modules raise this limit
  * Argo descriptions for training modules show the related limits
  * It's still possible to gain XP with successful kills
